1.	INTRODUCTION

Being a Canadian citizen and living in Edmonton for more than 7 years, I want to focus my project work within same city. My project will help for Restaurant business owners who wants to start their business career in Edmonton city and looking for better business location within this city to open an Indian restaurant. 


1.2	BUSINESS PROBLEM
Anyone who wants to start business in new city is challenging if they are not familiar with the location and they are not aware if business is targeted for the community within the neighborhood. Searching a best location for Restaurant is not an easy task in todayâ€™s world as there are several requirements needed to fulfill to get this task done. On top of that, we need to find better place where targeted customers are interested in your business. At present scenario, there are multiple restaurant businesses operating in almost each location. Customer are so selective that they want to visit/order from restaurant where they can find food of their choice.

1.3	Target
As a student of data science, I want to provide some research so that it will be easier for anyone who wants to start their career in this field as Restaurant owner and overcome this extra headache to find proper location for business. I will provide recommendation based on finding that they can consider before opening new restaurant.
